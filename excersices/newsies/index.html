   <p>LONDON (AP) -- In a warehouse at London's sprawling Heathrow Airport, a border officer pulls open a cardboard box he suspects contains contraband goods. Bingo - his instincts are rewarded. The box is packed with beige and black sneakers that to the untrained eye look identical to the limited edition <b style = "color: blue">Adidas Yeezy Boost</b>, designed by rap star <b>Kanye West</b>, which sold out within minutes of being released last year and now have a resale value many times their original retail price.</p>
   <p>In the past five years, the Border Force, the policing command under Britain's Home Office charged with immigration and customs controls, has seized thousands of consignments at Heathrow alone, <strong>valued at around Â£100 million ($125 million)</strong>, said Peter Herron, senior officer for specialist operations. "Anything a counterfeiter can counterfeit, they will."
   Annual trade in fake products was worth <b style = "color: red">$461 billion in 2013</b>, around 2.5 percent of total global trade, according to Piotr Stryszowski, an economist with the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The money goes to organized crime, and helps fund terrorism and the trafficking of drugs, people, sex and wildlife, as well as the lavish lifestyles of its kingpins.</p>
   <p>"It's the globalized illicit business of the 21st century," says Stryszowski, who laments it's not taken as seriously as other contraband, such as cocaine.
   Consumers may see fakes as "fun" and feel clever to buy sunglasses or sneakers that look like the real thing but cost a fraction of the price.
   The reality, however, is anything but fun for the workers, many of them children, who toil in appalling, often slave-like conditions in secret factories making fake products for gang bosses who, Stryszowski says, "have no ethics and no respect for the law."</p>
