# Simple Calculator
This was an exercise using vanilla JavaScript to build a website that takes inputs and creates new html elements based on the result of calculations on those inputs.

The requirements were as follows: 

- Have one section (<div>) for Add, Subtract and Multiply math operations (so 3 sections) total
- Each section has two inputs to take the first and second numbers
- Each section will have a button to perform the operation
- Inject the result into the HTML (not an alert)
- Have the website use 3 colors
- Have proper padding/spacing to lay things out nicely
