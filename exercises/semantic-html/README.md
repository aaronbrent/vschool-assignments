# Semantic HTML

This was an exercise in basic HTML and CSS

The requirements were as follows:

Write a static webpage using semantic html for a photography website. Your site should include:

- A header at the top of the page with the name of your photography business

- A side navbar (right or left) with links (that don't need to work)

- A main content section with pictures you want to display.

- A footer with contact information for your business.
