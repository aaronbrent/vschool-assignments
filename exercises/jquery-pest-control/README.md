# jQuery Pest Control

This was an exercise in using jQuery to handle events and data in the DOM. 

I used a previous project Mario Pest Control and added the following:

- Make it so every time the calculation is done, a mario "coin" sound is played. 

- For those who didn't let the users pick how many pests were killed, use the pipe-down sound when the page finishes loading. 

- Add a button for nighttime viewing. If the button is clicked, it should switch a lot of the background color to dark and the text to a light gray. If you have a background image, either add a dark shade over the image or replace the background image entirely either with a different image, or just with a dark solid background.

- Clicking the button should toggle it back and forth, and the text of the button should change from "dark mode" to "light mode" and back. (Or "night mode" and "day mode" if you prefer).
