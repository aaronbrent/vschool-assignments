# Tech Wish List

This is a website that displays my technology wish list.

The requirements:

- Use ngRoute and have two views

- Each view is in it's own folder with an associated controller

- File structure must be laid out professionally

- Have a way to navigate between the two views

- Build a restrict: "E" directive that:

    - Displays an item image

    - Shows the item name

    - Shows the item price

- Use that directive on each view template
(ie Your different view's controllers will pass in the appropriate data into the directives - thus one directive being re-used on multiple pages and showing each page's respective data)

- Use the built-in AngularJS currency filter to change all of your prices to Euros (â‚¬).
