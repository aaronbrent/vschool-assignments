# Angular Todo List

This exercise demonstrates the use of $http get, post, put and delete services to create, read, edit and destroy data from an API, in this case a todo list. All with seperate JS files for the contoller and services.

The project requirements were as follows:

- You will have a form that allows the user to add new todos
- Each todo will have a checkbox where it can be marked complete or incomplete
- If a todo item is complete, it should have a strikethrough line on it. Check out ngClass to help with this.
- A user should be able to delete a Todo item
- A user should be able to attach an imgUrl to the item (if there is an imgUrl, the image should be displayed)
- A user should be able to give the item a price
- A user should be able to give the item a description
- Website should be nicely laid out with Bootstrap
