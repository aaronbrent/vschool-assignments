This was a project to demonstrate an understanding of the following ocncepts:

Objects/Associative Arrays

Constructors or "Classes"

Callback functions

Functional programming concepts

The program simulates two opponents, each with a population of 1,000,000, automatically firing bombs back and forth until one side's population is completely destroyed. 

There is a simulated flip of a coin that decides who fires first. The destruction to each opponent's population is a random amount between two set numbers with each turn.
