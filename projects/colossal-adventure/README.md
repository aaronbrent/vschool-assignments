 The program is a simple game that uses readline-sync to take input from the player and direct the course of the game. The player will walk until attacked, then given the option to run or fight. Running has a 50/50 chance of escape. Whether through voluntarily fighting or failing to escape the player and enemy take turns dealing damage. The player gathers items and bonus health points from enemies. Once the player has gathered at least one of every item and killed every type of enemy they win. If all player points are depleted they lose.
