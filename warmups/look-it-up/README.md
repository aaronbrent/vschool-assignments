# Look It Up

A programming logic warmup with the following requirements:

- Allows the user to enter new words and saves them into your object (be sure to pass the object in as a parameter). 
- Does not allow duplicate words to be stored in the dictionary. This includes case-sensitivity.
- Allows the user to look up words in the dictionary and see the definition of that word.
