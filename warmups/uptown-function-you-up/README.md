# Uptown function you up

This was a warmup where I built three functions that take in an array of lyrics and manipulate it in different ways.

- The first function will take this array, and print it to the console. Make sure to add spaces in-between each word so it looks nice on the console

- The second function will do the same thing, but print the song backwards (starting with the word "pretty": "pretty so I'm myself kiss Gotta", etc.).

- The third function will print every other word to the console, i.e. "this that cold Pfeiffer", etc.
